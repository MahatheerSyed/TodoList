# TodoList
 A To-Do List is a simple tool to track and manage tasks. You can add tasks via an input field, view them in a list, mark them as completed with checkboxes, and delete tasks when done. It helps organize daily activities, improve productivity, and ensure no tasks are missed, making it ideal for personal or professional use.
